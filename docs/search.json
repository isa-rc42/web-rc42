    "text": "Max Weber (1864–1920) was a pioneering German sociologist, philosopher, and political economist, best known for his profound impact on the study of sociology and his theories on capitalism, bureaucracy, and religion. Born in Erfurt, Prussia, Weber grew up in an intellectually vibrant environment, which significantly influenced his scholarly pursuits.\nWeber studied law, history, economics, and philosophy at several universities, including Heidelberg and Berlin. His early academic career focused on law and economics, but he soon shifted to broader social sciences. He became a professor at the University of Freiburg and later at the University of Heidelberg.\nWeber’s most influential work, “The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism” (1905), argued that Protestant ethics and ideas influenced the development of capitalism. He is also known for his theory of bureaucracy, which described an ideal type of bureaucracy based on rational-legal authority, hierarchical structure, and formal rules and procedures.\nBeyond his academic contributions, Weber was actively involved in politics and participated in the drafting of the Weimar Constitution after World War I. His later works, such as “Economy and Society” and “Politics as a Vocation,” continued to explore the complexities of modern society, authority, and individual agency.\nWeber’s comprehensive approach to sociology, which integrated economic, political, and cultural dimensions, has left a lasting legacy, making him a foundational figure in the field. He passed away in Munich in 1920, but his ideas continue to influence sociological thought and research."

    "text": "Marianne Weber (1870–1954) was a prominent German sociologist, women’s rights activist, and writer, known for her contributions to feminist theory and her role in advancing women’s rights in Germany. Born Marianne Schnitger in Oerlinghausen, she married Max Weber in 1893 and became an integral part of his intellectual and personal life.\nMarianne Weber was a formidable scholar in her own right. She studied law and sociology, and her academic pursuits were heavily influenced by the intellectual milieu she shared with her husband and other scholars of the time. Her work often intersected with issues of gender, law, and sociology.\nOne of her most significant contributions was her book “Wife and Mother in the Development of Law” (1907), where she examined the legal and social status of women through history. She argued for the recognition of women’s work within the family and their rights as individuals, advocating for legal reforms to ensure gender equality.\nIn addition to her academic work, Marianne Weber was actively involved in the women’s movement in Germany. She was a member of the Federation of German Women’s Associations (BDF) and served as its chairwoman from 1919 to 1923. During her tenure, she worked tirelessly to advance women’s educational opportunities, legal rights, and social positions.\nAfter Max Weber’s death in 1920, Marianne Weber dedicated herself to preserving and promoting his intellectual legacy. She edited and published his unfinished works, ensuring that his contributions to sociology and social theory would be recognized and studied by future generations.\nMarianne Weber’s life and work were characterized by her commitment to social justice, gender equality, and intellectual rigor. Her contributions have left a lasting impact on feminist theory and the sociology of gender, cementing her place as a significant figure in the history of sociology. She passed away in Heidelberg in 1954."
